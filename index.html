 <p>FC Bayern Munich was founded in 1900 by 11 football players, led by Franz John.[4] Although Bayern won its first national championship in 1932, the club was not selected for the Bundesliga at its inception in 1963. The club had its period of greatest success in the mid-1970s when, under the captaincy of Franz Beckenbauer, it won the European Cup three consecutive times (1974â€“1976). Overall, Bayern have won six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles (German record), winning their sixth title in the 2020 final as part of a seasonal treble, after which it became only the second European club to achieve the seasonal treble twice. Bayern has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners' Cup, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally and the only German club to have won both international titles.</p>
